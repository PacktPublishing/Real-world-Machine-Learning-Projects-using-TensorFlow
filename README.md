# Real-World Machine Learning Projects Using TensorFlow [Video]
This is the code repository for [Real-World Machine Learning Projects Using TensorFlow [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/real-world-machine-learning-projects-using-tensorflow-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789340174), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Machine learning algorithms and research are mushrooming due to their accuracy at solving problems. This course walks you through developing real- world projects using TensorFlow in your ML projects. 

The initial projects will deal with assessing the viability of expanding your Restaurant business. You will use Linear Regression with an example involving buying and selling property at best prices. You'll master Support Vector Machines through building an e-mail spam filter. Next, you will create algorithms to detect anomalous behavior in server computers. Finally, you'll build a neural network and dataset from scratch for our Traffic Signal Classifier.

By the end of this course you will be using TensorFlow in real-world scenarios, and you'll be confident enough to use ML Algorithms to build your own projects.
